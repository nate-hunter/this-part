# this pArt

An app for users to share public art with the community
An app to (eventually) bring awareness to Art Education programs and recognize artists for their work.
(Donations may be accepted is a thought I'm considering)

#### For Now:

- An authenticated User can create a Post of Photos on a map.
- An authenticated User can view Photos on a map and in a gallery.

#### For Future:

- An unauthenticated User can view Photos on a map and in a gallery.
- An authenticated User can Comment, "React", and (considering) Rate a Post.
- Users may be able to assign or suggest artists and provide links to their social media accounts
