# this pArt

- An app for users to share public art with the community
- An app to (eventually) bring awareness to Art Education programs and recognize artists for their work.
  (Donations may be accepted is a thought I'm considering)

#### For Now:

- An authenticated User can create a Post of Photos on a map.
- An authenticated User can view Photos on a map and in a gallery.

#### For Future:

- An unauthenticated User can view Photos on a map and in a gallery.
- An authenticated User can Comment, "React", and (considering) Rate a Post.
- Users may be able to assign or suggest artists and provide links to their social media accounts
